# Web Link Integration Test

## Testing the Enhanced News API with Web Links

The system has been updated with the following improvements:

### 1. Web Search API (`/api/web-search`)
- **Location**: `src/app/api/web-search/route.ts`
- **Purpose**: Generates relevant web links for news headlines
- **Features**:
  - Intelligent query generation based on news content
  - Trusted sources prioritization (RBI, ICAI, GST Portal, etc.)
  - Relevance scoring for link quality
  - Fallback to static links if search fails

### 2. Enhanced News API Updates
- **Location**: `src/app/api/news/enhanced/route.ts`
- **Updates**:
  - `generateRelevantLinks()` now calls web search API
  - Async processing for better performance
  - Fallback mechanism for reliability
  - Promise-based architecture

### 3. Dashboard Integration
- **Location**: `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Displays up to 2 web links per news item
  - External link icons with hover effects
  - "More links" button for additional sources
  - Source attribution in tooltips

## Test Instructions

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   cd "c:\Users\Soumil\Downloads\AccountantAI-main"
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to dashboard**: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`

3. **Check news section**: Look for "Top News" section with web link buttons

4. **Test web links**:
   - Each news item should show relevant government/regulatory links
   - Links should open in new tabs
   - Hover effects should work properly
   - "More links" functionality should display additional sources

## Expected Results

### News Items with Links:
- **RBI News**: Links to RBI notifications, press releases
- **GST News**: Links to GST portal, CBIC notifications
- **ICAI News**: Links to ICAI updates, announcements
- **Tax News**: Links to Income Tax portal, filing guidelines
- **Corporate News**: Links to MCA notifications
- **SEBI News**: Links to SEBI circulars, press releases

### Link Quality Features:
- ✅ Government source prioritization
- ✅ Relevance-based filtering
- ✅ Professional presentation
- ✅ Reliable fallback mechanism
- ✅ Performance optimization

## Troubleshooting

If web links don't appear:
1. Check browser console for API errors
2. Verify `/api/news/enhanced?topNews=true` returns `relevantLinks`
3. Test `/api/web-search` endpoint directly
4. Ensure proper async/await handling

## Integration Complete

The web browsing functionality has been successfully integrated into the AccountantAI dashboard, providing users with instant access to relevant government and regulatory sources for each news headline.
