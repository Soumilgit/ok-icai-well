## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Workflow Node Structure
```typescript
interface WorkflowNode {
  id: string
  type: NodeType
  position: { x: number; y: number }
  data: {
    label: string
    nodeType: NodeType
    config: NodeSpecificConfig
    executionStatus: 'idle' | 'running' | 'completed' | 'failed'
  }
}
```

### Execution Engine Features

const isAdmin = user?.publicMetadata?.role === 'admin'
const isCompanyMember = user?.publicMetadata?.isCompanyMember === true
const hasWorkflowAccess = isAdmin || isCompanyMember
```

### Protected Routes
- `/workflow-builder` - Admin/Company members only
- Middleware enforcement for unauthorized access
- Conditional UI elements based on permissions

## 🧮 Technical Architecture
